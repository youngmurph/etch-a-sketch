This is my first full project, completed as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course.

It is a simple drawing board based on the 'Etch-a-Sketch'. The user is presented with a display that has a 16 x 16 grid with a random coloured pen generated on initialisation.

There is a button at the top of the display which allows the user to enter the number of squares squared they would like to see in the grid.

When the user is finished, it is best to refresh the page before drawing again.
